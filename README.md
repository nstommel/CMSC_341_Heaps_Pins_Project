# CMSC_341_Min_Max_Heaps
This project implements the data structures of Min and Max Heaps to make sorting and accessing high priority data efficient. Using these structures, we can guess the most commonly used pins/passwords based on an input file in order to get the most likely candidate as soon as possible by using a max heap.
